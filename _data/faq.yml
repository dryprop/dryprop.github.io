utilities:
  - question: When do I put the utilities in my name?
    answer: Tenants must have the gas and electric utilities switched to their name prior to their move-in date. You must call the gas and electric companies a week or so **before** your move-in date so that they can get everything started. There have been incidents in the past where tenants forgot to call or waited too long and then had to (literally) move into their new house in the dark as the electricity was switched off!

  - question: Who do I call?
    answer: Electricity - Toledo Edison [1-800-447-3333](tel:18004473333) or online at [Toledo Edison](https://www.firstenergycorp.com/service_requests/Start_Service.html#gsc.tab=0)

  - question: Is cable or internet included?
    answer: No, but most of our units are wired for cable and internet! Tenants wishing to obtain cable or internet service must setup this service on their own.

deposits:
  - question: How much do you require as a security deposit?
    answer: Security deposits are **one month's rent**. Said security deposit is to guarantee the return of the premises to the Owner in the same or better condition as when accepted by the Resident, reasonable wear expected. The security deposit is to indemnify Owner against damage and/or loss of value as a result of Resident's actions, mistakes or inactions during the term of the occupancy. Should the Resident be responsible for damage and/or loss of value to the premises greater than the value of the security deposit, Resident agrees to reimburse the owner for such loss immediately upon presentation of a bill for said damages and/or loss.

  - question: When do I get my security deposit back?
    answer: When you vacate your dwelling at the end of the lease, you are required to return the unit to us in the same standard of cleanliness as when you took occupancy. This includes cleaning the stove, fridge, oven, freezer, cabinets, bathroom, and general cleaning of the entire dwelling. A rule of thumb is that deposit refunds will be provided within 30 days unless there is a wait for the water bill. If you need your refund sooner, contact Dryfuse Campus Properties and an estimate of the water bill can be given!
