    description: I could not have asked for a better landlord. Our apartment was clean on arrival and everything worked like it should. Our place had everything it needed and was within walking distance to campus. If I hadn't graduated I would have rented from Dryfuse Campus Properties again!

    description: I rented with Dryfuse Properties for over two years and it was nothing but spectacular. Robert is very upfront, honest, and will take care of anything that needs to be done. He is very flexible and would highly recommend to anyone renting in the Toledo area.
